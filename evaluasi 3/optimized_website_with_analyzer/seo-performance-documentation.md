## Performance Measurement System

Five key performance metrics are being tracked:

- Measures how long it takes for the entire page to load
- Uses Navigation Timing API
- Optimal: < 3 seconds

### 2. First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Measures when the first content appears on the page
- Uses Performance Observer API
- Optimal: < 1.8 seconds

### 3. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Measures when the largest content element is visible
- Uses Performance Observer API
- Optimal: < 2.5 seconds

### 4. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Measures visual stability and unexpected layout shifts
- Uses Layout Instability API
- Optimal: < 0.1

### 5. First Input Delay (FID)
- Measures interactivity and responsiveness
- Uses Event Timing API
- Optimal: < 100ms

## Performance Optimization Techniques

The following techniques have been implemented to improve performance:

1. **Lazy Loading Images**
   - All images have the loading="lazy" attribute
   - IntersectionObserver fallback for older browsers

2. **Resource Hints**
   - Preconnect, prefetch, and preload for critical resources

3. **Optimized Script Loading**
   - Defer non-critical scripts
   - Async loading where appropriate

4. **Layout Shift Prevention**
   - Adding width and height attributes to images
   - Proper spacing and layout implementation

5. **Font Optimization**
   - Font-display: swap for better font loading

## SEO Analysis Tool

A JavaScript-based SEO analysis tool has been implemented to:

1. Analyze title tags, meta descriptions, headings, and content
2. Check for image alt attributes
3. Verify structured data implementation
4. Analyze URL structure
5. Provide recommendations for improvement

The tool generates a score and provides actionable recommendations for further optimization.
